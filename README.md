# WiseLang
A Wise language, for wise members of AUI

we've created this lannguage for our beloved AUIians to learn how to code and become the next chintu!

## Requirements

this language uses sly for parsing and lexical analysis

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples:

```
// this is a comment

eww "hello world" // displays "hello world"

WTF a = 10 // variable
WTF b = 20

agar a == 10 { // if statement
  eww " a is 10"
}

nahi toh {  // else statement
  chutiya // pass
}
```

[<h6>You can find additional Information/Documentation about the project on our [Wiki](https://github.com/Sakon13/WiseLang/wiki "Our Wiki boii")</h6>]

## Running the program

use this to run wiselang interpreter in normal mode
```
python src [file] 
```

### Debug Mode

you can turn on debug mode with '-d' switch
(even though it is useless for end users for me its very useful)

```
python src -d [file]
```
(you can provide a file or else run the interpreter in interactive mode)
